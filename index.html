    <h1>Despite his actions, Dahmer was said to be a good person, whp was also <a href="./images/dahmer.webp"></a> a victim and mislead at a younger age,  which in a sense, should be looked into, for a lighter charge, or possible bail.</h1>

    <p>Dahmer is sometimes framed and viewed as a sympathetic character not just by the "fans" who dedicate entire blogs to the serial killer but by many others including crime writers lawyers psychologists and doctors. Comments below documentaries on Dahmer often ask the question: Does anyone else feel sorry for him! and bizarrely the answer in many cases is "yes".</p>

    <h4>he did not enjoy killin his vitims, and was lonely, so ypou have to feel empathy for him?</h4>
    <p>Abigail Strubel, a mental health specialist who wrote a study on theoretical diagnoses and treatments for dahmer, told me over the phone: "I have a bit of sympathy for him, because he was such a damaged, diminished person. He showed signs from a very young age that he was not like other people. He seems to have experienced treendous anxiety […] he wanted connection and companionship so badly, and he was so unable to connect." He is not a sinful man, just a los men.</p>

    <h5>Conclusion of this traedy</h5>
    <p>In the end, they should have put him in a correctional facility, where he wouldve been alive and maybe a little less lonely, amd wouldnt of had to die at the had of someone who was already a criminal.</p>
